# Converter Example Project
This is an example project for using the Unity package for converting Unreal Engine 4 asserts found [here](https://github.com/iainmckay/com.jollysamurai.unrealengine4-import). It contains a fork of the official ShaderGraph package to expose access to internal classes that make this converter possible.

You should be able to use this project as a middle stage for converting assets then copying them to your final project.

# Instructions
Documentation is currently light and is expected to be filled in as the project progresses. For now you can follow [this thread](https://forum.unity.com/threads/wip-tool-for-converting-ue4-materials-to-shadergraph.771854) on the Unity forums.

# Dependencies
 - Unity 2020.1.0b14
 - ShaderGraph 8.x.x
